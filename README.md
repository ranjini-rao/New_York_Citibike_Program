# Ride information : 
Visualization for this helps us to understand the total ride count and increase and decrease numbers for all 5 weeks in October month
- The total number of rides in the month of October 2023 was 1,047,758.
- Total ride count per week was visualized for total 5 week for the month. We can see the highest ride counts in the 4th week of October with as high rides as 266,954. And the least being week 5 with the numbers 75,336.
- Ride count weekday per hour helps us to visualize the hourly information. Trend shows us ride traffic being increased in the evenings from 5PM to 9PM approximately on the weekdays. And weekends graph are very scattered.  [ The data for these graphs are only 5K due to limitation of Tableau]

# Bike Type and Member-Casual Information: 
On this we can see the types of bikes that have been used. Looking deeper I have also made visualizations to see the how of them were members and non members used the bikes. Below are my finds,
- Two types of bikes has been used. Classic bike being the highest used 992,730 and second type is electric bike being used the less 55,028.
- Looking further into the trends of members and non members using the 2 bikes, differences are very little. Members using electric bikes are up to 78.85% and classic bike being 81.18%. Similarly non member using electric bike is 21.15% and classic bike being 18.82%.
- Member usages by week shows us Weekdays are highest used as compared to weekends. It significantly shows the reduction in number of bike usage on Saturday. But for non members the numbers goes up on Sunday as compared to all other days of the week.

# Location Maps: 
I have created a dynamic map which shows how each Start and End Station popularity changes when we hover over the map. The map has Zip Code Boundaries and Zip Code Number data overlaid on the map. I have also added a layer for 2018 population information to the map. 
- There are two maps created - one to show the Start Stations data and the second for the End Stations data. 
- 2 Bar graphs shows us the top starting location and top ending location. One of the top locations being E 41st ST & Maddison Avenue (SE Corner) and top ending location being E 33 St & 1 Ave

# Average Trip Information: 
Calculating average duration between start time and end time. Below are my findings
- My first visualization is for total average trip duration. The trend here shows us highest trip between 10-20 minutes
- Average trip duration by weekdays shows us weekends being the highest of 16.750 minutes.
- Average trip duration by each day of the month shows us clearly there were only 2 Sundays when the trip duration increased to 16 minutes on average.
- In the heat Map representation we can see the average trip duration during Sunday is longer through out the day between 10 am to 7 pm. And Weekdays are mostly during 7 am to 9 am and in the evening 5 pm to 7pm.
